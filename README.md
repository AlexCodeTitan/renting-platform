# Tenant-Landlord Platform

## Project Overview

This Tenant-Landlord Platform is a web-based application designed to streamline the rental process for both tenants and landlords. It provides a platform where tenants can easily search for available apartments, apply for tenancies, and manage rent and utility payments. Landlords can manage their property listings, review tenant applications, and approve tenancies through the app. Built with React, TypeScript, Axios, and Styled Components on the front end, and a robust C# back-end, this project aims to simplify the rental experience with a focus on user experience and functional simplicity.
